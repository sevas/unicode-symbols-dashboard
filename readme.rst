What is this?
-------------

A Google Chrome extension to help you copy and paste unicode symbols.

Because there are many symbols, and I was not going to unfold the list by hand.
Hence, the Chrome extension is generated by a python program, which contains the ranges of symbols to generate.

The current list of symbols is not final, and the *Most used* tab is pretty subjective.
There is a unicode symbol you just can't live without? Hit me with your best suggestions.

Down with ASCII, the Internet needs more little stars and funny shapes.


Usage
-----

You should probably install the Google Chrome extension using the ``.crx`` file.

However, if you wish to rebuild the extension, run the ``make_all.sh`` shell script (from the ``scripts`` directory.)
Then you'll need to load the directory as an unpacked extension in Google Chrome.
Unless you wish to modify it, I'm unsure why you would do that.
